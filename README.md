# remote_control

Server-client based remote control, based on simple TCP sockets. Client executes received text as a shell command.
Also includes key logger and creates nircmd.exe on target's computer for extra commands to be run.
Server's GUI has inbuilt buttons for some basic commands (screenshot, change system volumte, etc...)

Start server.py first, then client.py. IP's are hardcoded at the moment.
